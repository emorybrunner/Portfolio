                <h3>My Skills</h3>
                <p>If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. You can get away with a lot. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. You need the dark in order to show the light.</p>

                <p>And maybe a little bush lives there. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. This is the fun part</p>
                
                <p>Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. Isn't that fantastic? Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow.</p>
